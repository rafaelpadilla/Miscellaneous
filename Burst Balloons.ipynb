If the you burst balloon **i** you will get **nums[left] $*$ nums[i] $*$ nums[right]** coins. Here **left** and **right** are adjacent indices of **i**. After the burst, the **left** and **right** then becomes adjacent.\n",

    "\n",
    "One way of solving this problem is to try all possible ways of bursting the balloons and see which order maximizes the final score. This can also be viewed as a **top-bottom** approach.<br>\n",
    "For the example presented by the problem (balloons [3, 1, 5, 8]), I created the following tree showing all possible cases:\n",

    "If we burst balloon 3 we will score 3 points, once $1*3*1=3$ (nums[left] $*$ nums[i] $*$ nums[right]). And as it is the first balloon we are bursting, the accumulated score is 3, shown as **acc** in the chart.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:** According to Note (2), the first $1$ is used because as the balloon we are bursting is the most left in this sequence, there is no other balloon on its left, therefore we will always consider its left balloon as $1$. This same rule applies for bursting the most right balloon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we are left with balloons 1, 5 and 8 as can be seen in the sequence. So we can continue exploring all the possible options of eliminating the balloons and in the end we observe all achievable final scores which are highlighted in the final branches of the tree.<br>\n",
