    "\n",
    "Given **n** balloons, indexed from **0** to **n-1**. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array **nums**. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon **i** you will get **nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right]** coins. Here **left** and **right** are adjacent indices of **i**. After the burst, the **left** and **right** then becomes adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:<br>\n",
    "(1) You may imagine **nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1**. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.<br>\n",
    "(2) 0 ≤ **n** ≤ 500, 0 ≤ **nums[i]** ≤ 100\n",
